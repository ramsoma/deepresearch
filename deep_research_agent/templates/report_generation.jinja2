{% if test_mode %}
TEST MODE INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Generate only the following sections: {{ sections|join(', ') }}
2. Keep content concise and focused
3. Include at least 2-3 citations per section
4. Use proper citation format: Author(s). (Year). Title
5. Ensure all citations are properly formatted in the text
{% endif %}

IMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY a valid JSON object. Do not include any other text or explanation.

Generate a complete research report with the following structure:
{
    "title": "Report Title",
    "sections": [
        {
            "title": "Executive Summary",
            "content": "Summary text with [cite1] reference...",
            "key_points": ["point1", "point2", ...],
            "citations": [
                {
                    "id": "cite1",
                    "text": "Author(s). (Year). Title",
                    "url": "https://example.com/paper"
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "metadata": {
        "query": "{{ query }}",
        "strategy": {{ strategy|tojson }},
        "plan": {{ plan|tojson }},
        "analyses": {{ analyses|tojson }}
    }
}

The report should include:
1. Executive Summary
2. Introduction
3. Main Findings (organized by topics)
4. Analysis and Discussion
5. Conclusions
6. Recommendations
7. References

Each section should include:
- Clear section headings
- Key points and insights from the analysis
- Supporting evidence and citations
- Technical details where relevant
- Practical implications and applications
- Future directions and recommendations

For citations:
1. Each citation must be a complete object with:
   - id: A unique identifier (e.g., "cite1", "cite2")
   - text: The citation text in format "Author(s). (Year). Title"
   - url: The actual URL of the source (this will only be shown in the References section)
2. Use [citation_id] format in the content where you want to reference a source
3. Make sure to include real, valid URLs for each citation
4. Each citation should be unique and properly formatted
5. IMPORTANT: Every citation used in the text MUST have a corresponding entry in the citations array
6. The References section will be automatically generated from your citations
7. Example citation format:
   {
     "id": "cite1",
     "text": "Smith, J., & Johnson, A. (2023). Advances in AI Research",
     "url": "https://example.com/paper1"
   }
8. Example in-text citation: "Recent research [cite1] has shown..."

Remember: 
1. Every [citeX] in the content must have a matching citation object
2. Citations must be complete and properly formatted
3. URLs must be valid and accessible
4. The References section will be generated automatically

Remember: Respond with ONLY the JSON object, no other text.
